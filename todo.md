* Intersections for rotated rectangles
* Add simple constant definitions, such as for colors
* Consider making name attribute not part of normal attribute list. Maybe
even require it.
* Add nested group support.
* Consider adding signal definitions to objects to control what happens on
events.
* Separate input logic from renderer into it's own class

* Implement generator for text
* Might be able to avoid re-rendering when zooming out, which will make things
sharper.
